# jwt-demo-backend

Lots of demo code came from here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-fullstack-authentication-system-with-react-express-mongodb-heroku-and-netlify/
This is a prototype for a backend authenticated with jwt, using ExpressJS and prisma with a SQLite database.

The corresponding frontend demo can be found here: https://github.com/abbievance/jwt-demo-frontend
